# PowerOps-Starter for GitLab
The accelerated way to get started with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for the Power Platform. 

Through the Push/Pull worksflows, we enable a GitOps style management of Power Platform, but also enable interoperability with your preferred client such Admin Center, PS or CLI, still maintaining the source of truth for all artifacts in Git.
